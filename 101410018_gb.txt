George Brown College (GBC) is a public college located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 
It offers a wide range of diploma, degree, and certificate programs in fields such 
as computer technology, business, health sciences, and design.

GBC emphasizes applied learning, where students gain both theoretical knowledge 
and practical, hands-on experience.

For me as a student, GBC provides the environment and resources to learn programming, 
develop problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in software 
development.
