Learning DevOps is important in the software development cycle.
It improves collaboration, communication, and efficiency across teams.
Automation in DevOps speeds up software delivery while reducing errors.
Continuous integration and deployment ensure faster updates and higher quality.
It helps students understand real-world practices used in modern IT industries.
Overall, DevOps builds skills needed for scalable, reliable, and agile software development


Software development teams rely on DevOps practices to efficiently 
deliver products and features through structured collaboration and 
shorter release cycles. Teams create pipelines that use automation to 
speed up slow, manual processes and enable frequent updates and releases. 
This automation involves plugins and frameworks that perform DevOps processes 
while requiring very little human assistance, eliminating human error and repetitive tasks, 
thus in turn, further streamlining DevOps pipelines.
