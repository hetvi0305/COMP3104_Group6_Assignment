-DevOps plays an important role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it integrates development and operations teams, creating a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility. 
-It emphasizes automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD), which speeds up software releases while maintaining high quality. 
-By using DevOps practices, organizations can detect and fix issues earlier in the cycle, reduce deployment failures, and ensure smoother, more reliable releases.
-This not only shortens the time-to-market but also allows teams to quickly adapt to customer needs and business changes, making the SDLC more efficient, flexible, and customer-focused.
