DevOps is important in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it bridges the gap between development and operations teams. 
It ensures faster delivery, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and better collaboration, which reduces errors and 
improves software quality. By automating testing, building, and deployment, DevOps helps in shortening release cycles, 
enhancing reliability, and responding quickly to changes or customer needs.
