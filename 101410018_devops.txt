COMP 3104 â€“ DevOps is a course that focuses on the principles and practices of 
continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation in software development. 

The course introduces tools such as Git, GitHub, and CI/CD pipelines, helping 
students learn how to collaborate effectively in a team environment. By working 
with branching strategies, pull requests, and workflows, students gain 
real-world skills that mirror professional DevOps practices.

Through this course, I expect to learn how DevOps improves efficiency in 
software projects and prepares me for working in modern software engineering teams.
