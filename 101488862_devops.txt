 How does DevOps work?
A DevOps team includes developers and IT operations 
working collaboratively throughout the product lifecycle, in
 order to increase the speed and quality of software deployment. I
 t’s a new way of working, a cultural shift, that has significant 
 implications for teams and the organizations they work for.

Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer 
“siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams merge into a single team where 
the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle — from 
development and test to deployment and operations — and have a range 
of multidisciplinary skills.

DevOps teams use tools to automate and accelerate processes, 
which helps to increase reliability. A DevOps toolchain helps 
teams tackle important DevOps fundamentals including continuous
 integration, continuous delivery, automation, and collaboration.
