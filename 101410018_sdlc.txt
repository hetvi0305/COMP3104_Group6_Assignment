DevOps plays a very important role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
It bridges the gap between development and operations by automating processes, 
improving communication, and enabling faster feedback.

By integrating DevOps practices into the SDLC:
- Continuous Integration ensures code is tested frequently and errors are caught early.
- Continuous Delivery allows new features to be deployed quickly and safely.


Learning DevOps is valuable because it prepares students to work in environments 
where rapid software delivery, collaboration, and quality are essential.

### Benefits of DevOps in SDLC
- Faster detection of bugs through continuous testing
- Frequent and reliable delivery of new features
- Improved collaboration between developers and operations
- Automated workflows reduce human error
