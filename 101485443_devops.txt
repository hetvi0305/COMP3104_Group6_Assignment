How does DevOps work?
A DevOps team includes developers and IT operations 
working collaboratively throughout the product lifecycle, in
 order to increase the speed and quality of software deployment. I
 t’s a new way of working, a cultural shift, that has significant 
 implications for teams and the organizations they work for.

Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer 
“siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams merge into a single team where 
the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle — from 
development and test to deployment and operations — and have a range 
of multidisciplinary skills.

DevOps teams use tools to automate and accelerate processes, 
which helps to increase reliability. A DevOps toolchain helps 
teams tackle important DevOps fundamentals including continuous
 integration, continuous delivery, automation, and collaboration.

 Overall, DevOps prepares students with practical skills in collaboration, automation, and continuous integration, which are essential in today’s software industry
